# Source: wikipedia:Black rot (grape disease)

Grape black rot is a fungal disease caused by an ascomycetous fungus, Guignardia bidwellii, that attacks grape vines during hot and humid weather. The disease "originated in eastern North America, but now occurs in portions of Europe, South America, and Asia. It can cause complete crop loss in warm, humid climates, but is virtually unknown in regions with arid summers." The name comes from the black fringe that borders growing brown patches on the leaves.
