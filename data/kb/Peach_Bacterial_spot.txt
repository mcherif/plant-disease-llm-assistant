# Source: wikipedia:Bacterial leaf scorch

Bacterial leaf scorch (commonly abbreviated BLS, also called bacterial leaf spot) is a disease state affecting many crops, caused mainly by the xylem-plugging bacterium Xylella fastidiosa. It can be mistaken for ordinary leaf scorch caused by cultural practices such as over-fertilization.


== Hosts ==
BLS can be found on a wide variety of hosts, ranging from ornamental trees (elm, maple, oak) and shrubs, to crop species including blueberry and almond.
