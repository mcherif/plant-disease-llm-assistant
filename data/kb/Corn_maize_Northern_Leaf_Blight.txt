Southern corn leaf blight (SCLB) is a fungal disease of maize caused by the plant pathogen  Bipolaris maydis (also known as Cochliobolus heterostrophus in its 
teleomorph state).
The fungus is an Ascomycete and can use conidia or ascospores to infect. There are three races of B. maydis: Race O, Race C, and Race T; SCLB symptoms vary depending on the infectious pathogen's race.
